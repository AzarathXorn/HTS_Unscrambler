# HTS_Unscrambler
Unscrambler program written for hackthissite.org programming mission 1.

Scrambled words get pasted into scramblist.txt over the 10 words already in there, as HTS changes the words each time.
Wordlist.txt does not need any changes.

This iteration lacks error handling if the file does not open, and the file opening is a little bit inelegant, but it completed the challenge within the 30 second mission time limit.
